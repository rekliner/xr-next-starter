## XR-NEXT-STARTER

This is a boilerplate of some useful React-XR specific items that I often start out with:

- VR/AR selection for the button.
- A zustand store tracking the type of XR Session
- A pose-aware default position enforcer.
- Interaction wrapper from enijar/react-xr-ui to simplfy clicks and such
- Uses Nextjs framework with some basic options prepared
- Simplified https service for localhost dev environment (since https is required for XR sessions)
- Some default 3d objects and helpers

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [https://localhost:300](https://localhost:300) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
